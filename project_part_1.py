""" project_part_1.py - Plotting the Graph

The purpose here is to plot the graph according to the selected industry regarding the data
from before the pandemic (2019) and during the pandemic (2020) the two year will correspond
to 2 different graphs and the x-axis will represent the average working hour while the y-axis
will be representing in the form of year and month.

This module contains all the necessary code to implement the first part of the project, and must be
imported in the main.py file.
